### UNIWA CTF 2020
> It was the first Capture the Flag contest for Greek universities. I was happy to be one of the CTF creators. It was a really nice experience for me as it was my first ever attempt to create challenges in 3 different categories. I hope it was a nice experience for everyone that participated. 

The CTF level was `introductory` and our goal was to embrace students from all over the Greece to test their basic skills in a variety of challenges.
